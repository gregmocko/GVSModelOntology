# Ontology Queries
## In progress, subject to major change
This is where queries will be stored, though they are also stored in the .rdf of the ontology itself. For now I will upload individual query statements in .txt files, or maybe in individual cells of an Excel table.

I might upload Int.rdf without any queries, or maybe with some "basic" queries. Though as the number of queries grows, this makes copy and pasting individually time-consuming.
## To Use
For now, manually copy and paste the query from the .txt file into a new SQWRL query. 

At the moment, queries are not generically formatted. For example, you can query specifically for the KPI's that the SAE J266 Standard prescribes, but I don't have a generic "query for all KPI's prescribed by a vehicle testing document" statement. A template-based querying approach would probably work best with an API.
