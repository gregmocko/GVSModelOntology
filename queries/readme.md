# Ontology Queries
## Very much in progress, subject to major change
This is where queries will be stored, though they are also stored in the .rdf of the ontology itself. For now I will upload individual query statements in .txt files, or maybe in individual cells of an Excel table.
## To Use
For now, manually copy and paste the query into a new SQWRL query. 

At the moment, queries are not generically formatted. For example, you can query specifically for the KPI's that the SAE J266 Standard prescribes, but I don't have a generic "query for all KPI's prescribed by a vehicle testing document" statement.
