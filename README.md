# GVSModelOntology
The Ground Vehicle Simulation Ontology (GVSO) comprise 4 ontologies that represent terms with the domain of physics based simulation of groud vehicle.s The GVSO is a domain specific ontology that imports the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). The GVSO is also based on the current state of the art as published in SAE standards. The ontologies within the GVSO include

* Environment Ontology
* Simulation Ontology
* Model Ontology
* Ground Vehicle Ontology
